# Hand Gesture Controlled Robo-Car

---

## Description

Gesture Controlled RoboCar is a robot which can be
controlled by human gestures. The user just needs to wear a gesture
device (hand glove) in which a sensor is included. The sensor will record
the movement of hand in a specific direction which will result in the
motion of the car in the respective directions. We can control the car
using accelerometer sensors connected to a hand glove. Accelerometer
sensor will allow the user to control the throttle of the car. Movement of
car is controlled by mechanism which involves rotation of forth and rear
wheels using motors.
